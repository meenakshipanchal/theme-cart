Of food that was deeply personal.\n\nBy 2020, most of it had vanished. In its place were processed, polished, packaged imitations. The gap between what we ate and what we trusted kept growing.\n\nSo we left our jobs. Went back to the villages. Sat with farmers. Set up our own micro-units. One cow. One kolhu. One farmer. One family at a time.\nAnd just like that, Anveshan began.",

Every batch is made in small, rural units run by farmer families. No brokers. No blending. No shortcuts.\n\nWe run 17-plus quality tests per batch. From A2 protein to heavy metals. From SNF to pesticide traces. Because purity is a promise that should come with proof.\n\nWhen a batch sells out, we pause. No overproduction. No rush. Just like harvests, we let food take its time.",

        "fixing_text": "Most brands still follow the old commodity model. Produce is bought in bulk. Mixed across farms. Processed in heat. Stored in plastic. Tested for shelf life, not nutrition.\n\nThis model pushes farmers out. And pulls quality down. We built Anveshan to change that.",

Every item every drop, every grain is traced back to small farms and collectives across India, where native seeds and indigenous cattle breeds (Sahiwal, Gir, Rathi, Tharparkar) are preserved.\n\nWe work with over 7000 farmers, all of whom know us by name and trust us with their best harvests. Each ingredient is procured directly, which creates a traceability that very few brands can promise.",

Our ghee is crafted using the traditional bilona method, a 30-hour process that revolves around small batches, slow churning, and careful simmering. No heating shortcuts, no blending.\n\nWe don't rush. We don't scale recklessly. Every batch, every bottle, respects the time it takes to make food right.",

From A2 protein to SNF (Solid Not Fat) percentages, from antioxidant levels to heavy metals and pesticide contamination. Every test is done by certified third-party labs, and every product only reaches you if it meets the highest standards.\n\nYou don't just have to trust us  you can trust the science.

This is possible only through micro-units - you could call it FMCG in reverse - which employs rural communities, strengthens local economies, and builds prosperity without displacement.\n\nWe don't chase scaling.
